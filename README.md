# GifTastic

Deployed project on GitHub: https://ccalilung.github.io/GifTastic

Background: This is a fun website that uses the GIPHY API. Enter a search term into the search field, and a button is created using JQuery methods. If you click the button, an API call is made to generate 10 GIFs based off that term. If you click on the gif, the gif will play; clicking again will stop it. The theme is Wrestlers and Wrestling Finishing Moves. 

Instructions: There are premade buttons for popular wrestlers of the 90s-00s. Click on any of the buttons to generate an API call for what GIFs exist for that wrestler. The first 10 still images will show up. Click on one to see the gif, and click once gain to stop it. 

You can also add your own gif by searching in the text box. Once you click "Add Button!" a button of that search will become available. Click it to perform the API call similar to the predefined buttons.
